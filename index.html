                When the Juno arrived in 2016, it found that Jupiter has a very
                diffuse core that mixes into its mantle. A possible cause is an
                impact from a planet of about ten Earth masses a few million
                years after Jupiter's formation, which would have disrupted an

                Despite consisting mostly of hydrogen and helium, most of

                The composition of Uranus's atmosphere is different from its
                bulk, consisting mainly of molecular hydrogen and helium. The
                helium molar fraction, i.e. the number of helium atoms per
                molecule of gas, is 0.15±0.03 in the upper troposphere.</span

                Neptune is the eighth and farthest-known Solar planet from the
                Sun. In the Solar System, it is the fourth-largest planet by
                diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant
                planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth, more massive than its
                near-twin Uranus.</span

              <span class="planet__paragraph-internal">
                Neptune's internal structure resembles that of Uranus. Its
                atmosphere forms about 5% to 10% of its mass and extends perhaps
                10% to 20% of the way towards the core. Increasing
                concentrations of methane, ammonia and water are found in the
                lower regions.</span
              >
              <span class="planet__paragraph-surface">
                Neptune's atmosphere is 80% hydrogen and 19% helium. A trace
                amount of methane is also present. Prominent absorption bands of
                methane exist at wavelengths above 600 nm, in the red and
                infrared portion of the spectrum.</span
